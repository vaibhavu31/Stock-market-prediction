# Stock market prediction for Bharti Airtel
A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks , which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange as well as those only traded privately. Examples of the latter include shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms.

This project provides a simple implementation of loading,visualizing and predicting data.
A predictive model was made that can be used to predict the value of future stocks of Bharti Airtel with the help of past data.
Model used was K-means as a means of clustering and SVM was used for prediction.

## K-Means
K-Means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. K-Means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

## SVM
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for both classification and regression purposes.SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane.

### Procedure
1. Data Pre-processing was done.
2. Data was divided into train and test sets.
3. K-Means was implemented to form clusters.
4. SVM was used for prediction and graph was plotted of expected vs predicted values.
5. Accuracy was calculated
